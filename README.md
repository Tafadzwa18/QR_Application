This Flutter project is a mobile QR code generator application. It allows users to create QR codes for two distinct purposes:

Student Information: Users can enter a student's name and class to generate a unique QR code containing that data.

Domain Names: Users can input a website domain (like www.example.com) to generate a QR code that, when scanned, directs to that URL.

The app uses the qr_flutter package to handle the QR code generation and displays the result directly on the screen. The user interface is simple,
featuring separate sections for each type of QR code generation.
